# VirtualGlasses

This Android App is intended to be paired with a Cardboard Virtual Reality Headset. 
This app is a passthrough display that helps visually imparied people see better.
Different filters can be applied to the camrea preview so that people that have trouble seeing certain colors can view the world better.
The magnetic trigger on the Carboard Headset can be used to increase the zoom of the camera in order to display an enlarged version of the world.
This app is not proven to help visually impaired people see better but I would greatly appreciate any feedback on if this app helps you out or not.
